                <p><strong>Last Updated: June 27, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>Welcome to Yodha: Battle Board ("the App"), a strategic online multiplayer board game developed by Drip Red Games ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"), which are stored locally on your device. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>

If you are under the age of 18, you must have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to use the App.</p>
                
                <h3>2. License to Use the App</h3>

                <h4>3.1 Guest Accounts</h4>
                <p>The App allows you to play as a guest using a unique identifier (Guest ID, e.g., #y1234567890) generated temporarily for each session. This Guest ID is not stored in any database and is deleted when you close the App.</p>
                <h4>3.2 User Conduct</h4>
                <p>When using the App, you agree to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not engage in abusive, harassing, or offensive behavior, including in chat features.</li>
                    <li>Not use cheats, hacks, or any unauthorized third-party software to gain an advantage.</li>

                    <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these conduct rules.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Gameplay and Online Features</h3>
                <h4>4.1 Online Multiplayer</h4>
                <p>The App connects players for online matches via a WebSocket server. You acknowledge that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An active internet connection is required for online gameplay.</li>
                    <li>We are not responsible for disruptions caused by network issues or server downtime.</li>
                    <li>Matchmaking is random, and you may be paired with players from different regions.</li>
                    <li>No gameplay data is stored in any database; all data is temporary and deleted after the session ends.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>4.2 In-Game Chat</h4>
                <p>The App includes a chat feature with pre-selected messages. These messages are sent directly to your opponent during gameplay and are not stored in any database or retained after the match ends.</p>
                <h4>4.3 Game Data</h4>
                <p>Your game progress, including match history and moves, is stored temporarily in your device’s memory during gameplay. No data is stored in a database or retained after you close the App or end a match.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>All content in the App, including but not limited to graphics, sounds, music, code, and game mechanics, is owned by Drip Red Games or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

                <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>The App uses third-party services, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication.</li>

                    <li>Audioplayers for sound effects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These services may temporarily process data (e.g., IP addresses) during gameplay but do not store it in any database. Please review their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Termination</h3>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at our discretion, without notice, for reasons including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violation of these Terms.</li>
                    <li>Suspected fraudulent or abusive activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since no data is stored, termination simply ends your ability to use the App.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your IP address is temporarily used to determine your approximate location (country) for matchmaking and to display a country code and flag. This data is not stored in any database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may temporarily access information about your device (e.g., device type, operating system) to optimize gameplay. This data is not stored.</li>

                <p>The App does not collect or require personal information such as your name, email address, or payment details. No account creation is needed, and you play as a guest.</p>
                
                <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use temporary data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Facilitate online multiplayer gameplay, including matchmaking and communication between players.</li>

                <p>No data is stored in a database or retained after you close the App.</p>
                
                <h3>3. How We Share Your Information</h3>
                <p>We do not store or sell any user information. Temporary data may be shared as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The App uses third-party services (e.g., WebSocket, WebRTC, Connectivity Plus, Audioplayers) that may temporarily process data like IP addresses during gameplay. These services do not store data in a database. Please review their privacy policies for details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose temporary data if required by law or in response to a court order or government request. Since no data is stored, such disclosures would be limited to real-time data.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Other Sharing:</strong> We do not share any data with third parties for marketing or other purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
                <p>We do not store any user data in a database. All data (e.g., IP address, Guest ID, gameplay data, chat messages) is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processed temporarily in your device’s memory or during server communication.</li>
                    <li>Deleted when you end a match or close the App.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No data persists after your session ends.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Security</h3>
                <p>We use reasonable security measures, such as encryption for WebSocket and WebRTC communications, to protect temporary data during transmission. Since no data is stored in a database, there is no risk of data breaches from stored information. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security during gameplay.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
                <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or process personal information from children under 13. Since no data is stored, any temporary data from a child under 13 would be deleted after the session. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the App, please contact us.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>The App uses the following third-party services, which may temporarily process data during gameplay but do not store it:</p>
                <ul>

                <h3>8. International Data Transfers</h3>
                <p>Since the App supports global matchmaking, temporary data like your IP address or Guest ID may be processed by servers outside your country during gameplay. This data is not stored and is deleted after your session. By using the App, you consent to this temporary data transfer.</p>

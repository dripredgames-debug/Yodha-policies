            <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: August 14, 2025</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome to Yodha: Battle Board ("the App"), a casual, localized online multiplayer board game developed by Dripredgames ("we," "us," or "our"). This is our first game, designed to be accessible in multiple languages, with ongoing improvements to enhance gameplay. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"), which are stored locally on your device. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
            <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>By accessing or using the App, you confirm that you are at least 13 years of age (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to use online services) and agree to comply with these Terms. If you are under 18, you must have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to use the App.</p>
            <h3>2. License to Use the App</h3>
            <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms. You may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify, disassemble, decompile, or reverse-engineer the App.</li>
                <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
                <li>Distribute, sell, or sublicense the App or any part thereof.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Account and User Conduct</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Guest Accounts</h4>
            <p>The App allows you to play as a guest using a unique identifier (Guest ID, e.g., #y1234567890) generated temporarily for each session. This Guest ID is not stored in any database, not linked to any personal information, and is deleted when you close the App.</p>
            <h4>3.2 User Conduct</h4>
            <p>When using the App, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be respectful and courteous to other players, especially in the in-game chat feature, using only pre-selected messages.</li>
                <li>Not engage in abusive, harassing, or offensive behavior, including in chat interactions.</li>
                <li>Not use cheats, hacks, or any unauthorized third-party software to gain an advantage.</li>
                <li>Not impersonate others or provide false information.</li>
                <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these conduct rules.</p>
            <h3>4. Gameplay and Online Features</h3>
            <h4>4.1 Online Multiplayer</h4>
            <p>The App connects players for online matches via a WebSocket server. You acknowledge that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An active internet connection is required for online gameplay.</li>
                <li>We are not responsible for disruptions caused by network issues or server downtime.</li>
                <li>Matchmaking is random, and you may be paired with players from different regions, with support for multiple languages to enhance accessibility.</li>
                <li>No gameplay data, including match history or moves, is stored in any database; all data is temporary and deleted after the session ends.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4.2 In-Game Chat</h4>
            <p>The App includes a chat feature with pre-selected messages to foster respectful communication. These messages are sent directly to your opponent during gameplay, are not stored in any database, not shared with third parties, and are deleted when the match ends.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Game Data</h4>
            <p>Your game progress, including match history and moves, is stored temporarily in your device’s memory during gameplay. No data, including Guest IDs, is stored in a database or retained after you close the App or end a match.</p>
            <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>All content in the App, including graphics, sounds, music, code, and game mechanics, is owned by Dripredgames or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. The unique concept and mechanics of the "sandwich" feature, as implemented in Yodha: Battle Board, are copyrighted by Dripredgames.

            <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The App uses third-party services, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication.</li>
                <li>WebSocket for server communication.</li>

            <p><strong>Last Updated: August 14, 2025</strong></p>
            <p>Dripredgames ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy, stored locally on your device, explains how we handle information when you use Yodha: Battle Board ("the App"), our first casual board game, localized for multiple languages worldwide. We do not collect, store, or share any user information, including Guest IDs, chat messages, or game sessions, with any database or third parties. Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your IP address is temporarily used to determine your approximate location (country) for matchmaking and to display a country code and flag. This data is not stored in any database or shared with third parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may temporarily access information about your device (e.g., device type, operating system) to optimize gameplay. This data is not stored.</li>

                <li><strong>Guest ID:</strong> A randomly generated Guest ID (e.g., #y1234567890) is created for each session to identify you during gameplay. This ID is not linked to personal information, not stored in any database, not shared with third parties, and is deleted when you close the App.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Information You Provide</h4>
            <p><strong>Chat Messages:</strong> The App allows you to send pre-selected chat messages during gameplay to communicate respectfully with opponents. These messages are sent directly to your opponent, are not stored in any database, not shared with third parties, and are deleted when the match ends.</p>
            <h4>1.3 No Personal Information</h4>
            <p>The App does not collect or require personal information such as your name, email address, or payment details. No account creation is needed, and you play as a guest.</p>
            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use temporary data to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilitate online multiplayer gameplay, including matchmaking and communication between players in multiple languages.</li>
                <li>Display your country flag and Guest ID to opponents for a personalized experience.</li>
                <li>Optimize the App’s performance during your session.</li>
                <li>Detect and prevent cheating or abuse during gameplay.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No data is stored in a database, retained after your session, or shared with third parties.</p>
            <h3>3. How We Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>We do not store, sell, or share any user information with third parties. Temporary data may be processed as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The App uses third-party services (e.g., WebSocket, WebRTC, Connectivity Plus, Audioplayers) that may temporarily process data like IP addresses during gameplay. These services do not store data in a database or share it with others. Please review their privacy policies for details.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose temporary data if required by law or in response to a court order or government request. Since no data is stored, such disclosures would be limited to real-time data.</li>
                <li><strong>No Other Sharing:</strong> We do not share any data with third parties for marketing or other purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We do not store any user data in a database. All data (e.g., IP address, Guest ID, gameplay data, chat messages) is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processed temporarily in your device’s memory or during server communication.</li>
                <li>Deleted when you end a match or close the App.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No data persists after your session ends.</p>
            <h3>5. Security</h3>
            <p>We use reasonable security measures, such as encryption for WebSocket and WebRTC communications, to protect temporary data during transmission. Since no data is stored in a database, there is no risk of data breaches from stored information. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security during gameplay.</p>
            <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
            <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or process personal information from children under 13. Since no data is stored, any temporary data from a child under 13 would be deleted after the session. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the App, please contact us.</p>
            <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The App uses the following third-party services, which may temporarily process data during gameplay but do not store or share it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WebSocket (Glitch):</strong> Facilitates server communication. May temporarily process IP addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>WebRTC (flutter_webrtc):</strong> Enables peer-to-peer gameplay. May temporarily process IP addresses.</li>

            <h3>8. International Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>Since the App supports global matchmaking with multiple language options, temporary data like your IP address or Guest ID may be processed by servers outside your country during gameplay. This data is not stored, not shared with third parties, and is deleted after your session. By using the App, you consent to this temporary data transfer.</p>
            <h3>9. Your Choices</h3>

                <li><strong>Opt-Out of Chat:</strong> You can choose not to use the in-game chat feature to avoid sending messages and maintain respectful interaction.</li>
